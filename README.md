# askProperlyForHelporQuestionsToTechs
A descriptive guide on how to ask properly a tech to help you. Don't be a moron.

While asking for help, you need to provide error code/text, and script or pre-acts that could issue to the problem.

For the case of an error on a tool:
1. Make a proper, descriptive title of tyour problem, but make it simple.
2. Provide the error code
3. Give your terminal, not maybe entire, but the commands and responds related to your problem.

For example, look at this person asking help for his hashcat not running.

Forgetting other reasons that he didn't got any answers, can you find the problem?
There's no terminal output, only codes and explanation with his words. Your words are to support the terminal output, not to build a resposnse by itself.

Here, we have a proper title, terminal output with error code and text that adds to the terminal output.
